# Python Learning Folder

This folder contains all Python exercises, problem sets, and small projects I work on as part of my learning journey.  
It is organized to help track progress, practice consistently, and keep code clean and structured.

## 📚 Purpose

This folder is part of my main **learning repository**, where I track my progress with Python.  
It includes:

- **Small scripts** to practice basic concepts  
- **Mini-projects** like the Guessing Game to build practical, playable programs  
- Room for larger problem sets as I advance

The goal is to maintain a clear history of learning, experimentation, and improvement over time.
