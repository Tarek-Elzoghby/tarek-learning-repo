# Python Small Scripts

This folder contains **small, single-file Python programs** created for practice and learning.  
These scripts are self-contained and focus on basic programming concepts, problem-solving, and small automation tasks.

## 📚 Purpose

This folder is meant for **learning, practice, and experimentation** with Python.  
It helps keep all small exercises organized in one place while leaving room for larger problem sets in separate folders.
