# Python Small Scripts

This folder contains **small, single-file Python programs** created for practice and learning.  
These scripts are self-contained and focus on basic programming concepts, problem-solving, and small automation tasks.

## 📝 Current Scripts

- `coke.py` — simulates a coin-operated machine and calculates change  
- `suffix.py` — determines MIME type based on file extension  
- `vanity_plate.py` — validates vanity license plates  
- `figlet.py` — prints text in ASCII art using random or user-selected fonts  
- `fuel.py` — converts a fraction input into a fuel percentage and displays `E` or `F` when near empty or full  
- `Grocery_List.py` — counts and sorts items from user input into an organized shopping list  
- `Outdated.py` — converts dates from various formats into a standard YYYY-MM-DD format  
- `Taqueria.py` — simulates a taco shop order system, showing running totals for ordered menu items 
- `guess.py` — a number guessing game with input validation and hints  
- `professor.py` — practice script demonstrating logic, loops, or other fundamentals (replace with a short one-line description if needed)
- `Bitcoin.py` — fetches the current Bitcoin price and calculates the total value for a user-specified amount 
- `numbers.py` — A Python script that validates IPv4 addresses by enforcing correct dot-decimal format and octet range constraints (0–255). 
- `working.py` — A Python program that validates and converts 12-hour time ranges into 24-hour format, handling edge cases and invalid input gracefully.
- `um.py` — Counts occurrences of the word ‘um’ in text, ensuring it’s treated as a standalone word, case-insensitively.
- `seasons.py` — A Python program that calculates how many minutes have passed since your birth using date arithmetic and prints the result in words, accounting for leap years and strict input validation.

## 📚 Purpose

This folder is meant for **learning, practice, and experimentation** with Python.  
It helps keep all small exercises organized in one place while leaving room for larger problem sets or playable programs in separate folders.
